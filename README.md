# Digital Agriculture: IoT-driven Plant Disease Detection from Leaf Images

Leaf disease is a term used to describe any condition
or disorder that affects the leaves of plants. Symptoms of leaf
diseases can include discoloration, wilting, spotting or other
abnormal changes. It is important to detect such diseases in
a timely manner so that appropriate remedial measures can be
taken. Recent research has explored various sophisticated models
for detecting and classifying leaf diseases. Different approaches
such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Hybrid CNN, KNearest
Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM)
have been used to categorize plant leaf conditions. In this paper,
we have focused on YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 to identify leaf
diseases. We have accomplished this by modifying an existing
dataset on our own. Our best model, which is trained with yolov5
has acquired an F1-score of 88%.
